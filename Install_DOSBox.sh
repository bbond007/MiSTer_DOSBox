# You can download the latest version of this script from:
# https://github.com/bbond007/MiSTer_ScummVM
# Version 2.1.2 - 2019-07-18 - Adapt for use with ScummVM_Installer.sh --> BinaryBond007
# Version 2.1.1 - 2019-06-10 - Testing Internet connectivity with github.com instead of google.com.
# Version 2.1   - 2019-02-23 - CURL RETRY OPTIONS by wesclemens, now the script has a timeout and retry logic to prevent spotty connections causing the update to lockup; thank you very much.
# Version 2.1   - 2019-02-23 - Code review by frederic-mahe, now the script is more standardized and elegant, thank you very much; ALLOW_INSECURE_SSH renamed to ALLOW_INSECURE_SSL.
# Version 2.0   - 2019-02-02 - Added ALLOW_INSECURE_SSH option: "true" will check if SSL certificate verification (see https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html ) is working (CA certificates installed) and when it's working it will use this feature for safe curl HTTPS downloads, otherwise it will use --insecure option for disabling SSL certificate verification. If CA certificates aren't installed it's advised to install them (i.e. using security_fixes.sh). "false" will never use --insecure option and if CA certificates aren't installed any download will fail.
# Version 1.0   - 2019-01-07 - First commit
