# MiSTer_DOSBox
DOSBox 0.74-3 build for MiSTer Linux HPS

Run Install_DOSBox.sh to install :) 

DOSBox will be installed to --> /media/fat/DOSBox

The scripts to launch it will be installed to --> /media/fat/Scripts

Configuration files will reside in --> /media/fat/DOSBox/Configs

Put your DOS files in --> /media/fat/DOSBox/C

I have included VGA and Tandy configurations. 

The speed is 80386 level performance, which is fine for me as I am mostly interested in the Tandy/pcJr GFX
